cvlib : : It's a method of detecting objects using cvlib as a code made by myself,
and the disadvantage is that objects that are not in the cvlib library are difficult to detect, 
but it's important to check if they fit my research!  There's nothing I can do myself
because it's also bringing in the library, but the advantage is that I can easily use the code!

webcam_detection : : Using the cvlib library is the same, but it's a code that allows you to detect objects in real time using webcams 
(although it's not really the code I need, it doesn't seem bad to check it out! )
